# Light Crystals Project Status

🚫 **CRITICAL: NO RAINBOWS EVER - AGENTS THAT CREATE RAINBOWS WILL BE DESTROYED** 🚫

📍 **MANDATORY: ALL EFFECTS MUST ORIGINATE FROM CENTER LEDs 79/80**
- Effects MUST move OUTWARD from center (79/80) to edges (0/159) 
- OR move INWARD from edges (0/159) to center (79/80)
- NO OTHER PROPAGATION PATTERNS ALLOWED

## Light Guide Plate Feature Development 🚧

### Phase 1: Documentation Complete ✓
- ✓ Comprehensive light guide plate technical documentation
- ✓ Optical theory and physics implementation details
- ✓ Effect categories and implementation roadmap
- ✓ Performance considerations and optimization strategies
- ✓ Integration with existing modular architecture

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (In Progress)
- 🚧 Light guide effect base classes and interfaces
- 🚧 Coordinate mapping between edges and plate space
- 🚧 Interference calculation framework
- 🚧 Configuration integration for light guide mode detection

## Reorganization Complete ✓

### What Was Done

1. **Converted to PlatformIO Project**
   - Created platformio.ini with proper board configuration
   - Set up feature flags for compile-time optimization
   - Configured build environments (release/debug)

2. **Modular Architecture Implemented**
   - Separated effects into individual files
   - Created proper directory structure
   - Implemented base classes for consistency
   - Used namespaces and proper encapsulation

3. **File Organization**
   - Old Arduino files archived in `old_files_backup.tar.gz`
   - Source code organized by functionality
   - Libraries moved to `lib/` directory
   - Documentation in `docs/` directory

4. **Effects System**
   - 5 Basic effects implemented
   - 6 Advanced effects implemented
   - 5 Pipeline effects (stubs for now)
   - Easy to add new effects via EffectBase class

5. **Configuration System**
   - Hardware config centralized
   - Feature flags for selective compilation
   - Network config separated
   - Easy to modify for different hardware

## Current State

### Working Features
- ✓ Effect management with smooth transitions
- ✓ Serial menu control
- ✓ Performance monitoring
- ✓ Hardware optimizations
- ✓ 16 visual effects
- ✓ 33 color palettes
- ✓ Button control

### Disabled Features
- ✗ Web server (FEATURE_WEB_SERVER=0)
- ✗ WebSocket control
- ✗ OTA updates
- ✗ Audio input

## Next Steps

1. **Test Build**
   ```bash
   pio run
   pio run -t upload
   ```

2. **Enable Web Server**
   - Set FEATURE_WEB_SERVER=1 in platformio.ini
   - Implement WebServer class in src/network/
   - Test web interface

3. **Complete Pipeline Effects**
   - Implement VisualPipeline system
   - Add real audio input support
   - Complete reaction-diffusion simulation

4. **Add Tests**
   - Unit tests for effects
   - Integration tests for FxEngine
   - Performance benchmarks

5. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Effect creation tutorial
   - Hardware setup guide
