# MATRIX R&D Protocol System

## 🎯 Purpose
This protocol system provides structured workflows for MATRIX (9x9 LED grid) research and development, incorporating innovations from both the original matrix implementation and strips evolution.

## 📋 Available Protocols

### 1. `create-hypothesis.mdc`
**Purpose**: Generate structured research hypotheses for MATRIX innovations  
**Usage**: `ai create-hypothesis "Innovation Title"`  
**Output**: Structured hypothesis document with success criteria and validation plan

### 2. `design-experiment.mdc` (Coming Soon)
**Purpose**: Create detailed experimental protocols for hypothesis validation  
**Usage**: `ai design-experiment hypothesis-file.md`  
**Output**: Step-by-step experimental procedure with benchmarks

### 3. `run-benchmark.mdc` (Coming Soon)
**Purpose**: Execute performance benchmarks and capture metrics  
**Usage**: `ai run-benchmark experiment-file.md`  
**Output**: Performance data and comparison tables

### 4. `validate-innovation.mdc` (Coming Soon)
**Purpose**: Validate results against success criteria  
**Usage**: `ai validate-innovation benchmark-results.md`  
**Output**: Pass/fail report with recommendations

## 🎨 MATRIX Innovation Categories

### 1. **2D Physics** 
Leverage the 9x9 grid for true 2D physical simulations impossible on 1D strips.

### 2. **Transitions**
Create spatially-aware transitions that utilize the matrix layout.

### 3. **Performance** 
Apply FastLED optimizations and strips learnings to matrix algorithms.

### 4. **Visual Effects**
Design effects that showcase the unique capabilities of a 2D display.

### 5. **Cross-Pollination**
Combine the best of both worlds - matrix spatial awareness + strips optimizations.

## 📊 Success Metrics

All MATRIX innovations are evaluated against:

- **Performance**: Maintain 120 FPS baseline
- **Memory**: Minimize heap allocation (<1KB per effect)
- **CPU Usage**: Stay under 25% for effect calculations
- **Visual Impact**: Demonstrate clear advantage over 1D
- **Code Quality**: Modular, reusable, well-documented

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Identify an innovation opportunity**
   - Something strips does well that matrix could adapt
   - Something only possible in 2D space
   - A performance optimization applicable to matrix

2. **Create your hypothesis**
   ```bash
   ai create-hypothesis "2D Particle Collision System"
   ```

3. **Follow the protocol workflow**
   - Each step builds on the previous
   - Validation gates ensure quality
   - Results feed back into innovation portfolio
